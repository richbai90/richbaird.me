Designing a filter that works on the principles of diffraction and phase shift can be framed as an optimization problem involving two key equations: one for the diffraction angle and another for the phase shift.

### 1. Diffraction Angle Equation

The diffraction angle can be described using the grating equation, which is derived from the principle of diffraction for a periodic structure (such as your array of quartz columns). The grating equation is given by:

$$ d (\sin \theta_i + \sin \theta_d) = m \lambda $$

where:
- $( d )$ is the distance between adjacent columns (the grating period).
- $( \theta_i )$ is the incident angle of the light.
- $( \theta_d )$ is the diffraction angle.
- $( m )$ is the diffraction order (an integer, where \( m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \)).
- $( \lambda )$ is the wavelength of the light.

### 2. Phase Shift Equation

The phase shift introduced by each quartz column can be described by:

$$ \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi n h}{\lambda} $$

where:
- $( \Delta \phi )$ is the phase shift.
- $( n )$ is the refractive index of the quartz.
- $( h )$ is the height of the quartz column.
- $( \lambda )$ is the wavelength of the light.

### Optimization Problem

The goal is to optimize the heights \( h \) of the quartz columns to achieve the desired diffraction angles and phase shifts. This involves setting up an optimization problem that simultaneously considers both the grating equation for diffraction and the phase shift equation.

#### Objective Function

Define an objective function \( f \) that combines both the diffraction angle and phase shift requirements. For example:

$$f(h) = w_1 \left( d (\sin \theta_i + \sin \theta_d) - m \lambda \right)^2 + w_2 \left( \frac{2\pi n h}{\lambda} - \Delta \phi \right)^2 $$

where:
- $( h )$ is a vector of column heights.
- $( w_1 )$ and $( w_2 )$ are weighting factors that balance the importance of achieving the desired diffraction angle and phase shift.

#### Constraints

You might also have constraints, such as physical limits on the heights of the columns:

$$ h_{\text{min}} \leq h \leq h_{\text{max}} $$

### Optimization Algorithm

You can use numerical optimization algorithms to find the optimal heights \( h \). Common algorithms include gradient descent, genetic algorithms, or other nonlinear optimization methods.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Define the Objective Function**:
   - Write the objective function in a programming language like Python.

2. **Set Initial Parameters and Constraints**:
   - Define the initial guess for the column heights and any constraints.

3. **Choose an Optimization Algorithm**:
   - Select and implement an appropriate optimization algorithm.

4. **Run the Optimization**:
   - Execute the optimization process to find the optimal heights.

5. **Validate the Results**:
   - Simulate the diffraction and phase shift with the optimized heights to ensure they meet your design criteria.

By solving this optimization problem, you can design a filter that precisely controls the diffraction and phase shifts to achieve the desired spatial and spectral encoding of the image.
